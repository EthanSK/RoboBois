##Q2
* Whathappens in each case if you use your hand to try to gently slow down the running motor? 
* What can you observe in the power and velocity of the motor? 
* Why can you observe this?

##Q4
* What is the approximate scatter range of the different outcomes? 
* Is there a systematic error (meaning that the final locations are consistently different from the ideal result with an error in the same direction)? 
* Is there much scatter, such that the points are quite spread out from each other?

##Q5
* Why do we have covariance as well as just the normal variance?
Because this shows the effect of both co-ordinates on each other, as opposed to their own independent variance, or something along these lines?

##Further Thought
* Which causes a larger effect on your robot, imprecision in drive distance or rotation angle?
* Can you think of any robot designs which would be able to move more precisely?
* How should we go about equipping a robot to recover from the motion drift we have observed in this experiment?
Gyro sensor? Line tracing with colour sensor?
