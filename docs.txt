To connect remotely to the RPi:
    1. copy the file over to doc machine using: scp scripts/ssh-pi <college username>@shell4.doc.ic.ac.uk:/tmp/  
    2. connect to the doc computer:  scripts/remote_connect.sh
    3. on it, move the file from /tmp to the home folder by doing: mv /tmp/ssh-pi .
    4. now you can run ./ssh-pi after connecting to the doc computer without having to know the ever changing ip of the pi

plan for the challenge:

- we know our location, and we know the map

- create an occupancy grid of particles, each particle having a flag stating if it is part of the wall or not (to ensure we don't change the weights of particles that are walls)

- go to the center of each area A B and C, spin the sonar, and update the occupancy grid (we update it by adding sonar angle and depth measurement to the robot rotation and position)
- remember we have to stop every few cm and spin sonar along the way to the center of each area

- after the update, scan the new grid of particles for clusters of particles (that are not part of the wall) where each particle in that cluster have weight > n.

([roughly] we can find clusters by looping through each particle in the grid, if particle.weight > n, then trigger a function that recursively calls for the adjacent particles, and whose stop condition is if the particle weight < n or if the particle is part of the wall.)  ACTUALLY we can do this with convolution kernel

- if the number of particles in a found cluster (within a certain area A B or C) is > x, we know it is probably a soda bottle. Therefore, move to the mean of the particles in that cluster. 

- move until the bump sensor detects a collision. If we have moved way past the average (y cm) and still havent detected a bump, then something fucked up and we need to go back to step 1.

- After a successful collision, move to the next area and repeat.
