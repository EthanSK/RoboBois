    1. copy the file over to doc machine using: scp scripts/ssh-pi <college username>@shell4.doc.ic.ac.uk:/tmp/  
    2. connect to the doc computer:  scripts/remote_connect.sh
    3. on it, move the file from /tmp to the home folder by doing: mv /tmp/ssh-pi .
    4. now you can run ./ssh-pi after connecting to the doc computer without having to know the ever changing ip of the pi
